This software is developed for the LabVIEW operating environment.  It is designed to allow those with a small introduction to robotics to be able to build useful robotic models.  The robot is defined by an arbitrary length kinematic chain with an arbitrary number of branches/splits.  Included are tools that perform forward and inverse kinematics (as well as forward/inverse derivatives thereof--velocity/acceleration).  It also performs inverse dynamics--you specify mass and inertial properties along with joint positions, velocities, and accelerations, and the code will return the forces and torques the robot will see at the joints and links.
